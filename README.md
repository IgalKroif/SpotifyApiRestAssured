Hello and welcome to my Spotify API repository 

The purpose was to build a framework for automating spotify requests and making a few assertion. this is my beginner project where I created a framework using maven and implemented the extent reports library 
For testing purposes I used Java's Rest Assured Library.

in order to run this you would need to run "testng.xml" file which runs all the neccessary Test cases

NOTE: It would seem that the spotify API is a tad broken so I couldn't use POST, PUT, DELETE because it requires an authorization with scope which seems non functional.
